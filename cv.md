##  About Me ##

I started my journey with design and realized that I wanted to be able to implement the project to the end, including development.
So I decided to become a front-end developer. I am inspired to help people and making them happier and life better and more convenient.
I have a calm, assiduous character and a creative streak. I love reading and animals too :)

## Code Example ##
**DESCRIPTION:**
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. 
You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

```
function removeChar(str){
  return str.slice(1, str.length - 1);
};
```
